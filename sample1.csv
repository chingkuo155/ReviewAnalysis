2,B09HN4DHFL,4,Positive,"I loved these earbuds and they lasted me for years. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although I ordered teal and the product arrived with a ""teal"" product label on the box, they were black instead.",2024-06-03 09:45:33
3,B0C7QR4QNP,5,Positive,"I really worried about the comfort of these as I have had a lot of issues with ear buds not fitting right, usually too big or way too small. I love these as I can find the perfect fit and they stay in my ears. The sound quality is really good and the battery life is excellent. I charged the base station once and haven't had to charge it since. I use them at work for 2-3 hours a night. I can only have one ear in at a time as I need to hear what is going on around me, and if I have both in then I would only hear the music. I tested. I have also used them for phone calls and they work great for that too. Love the touch feature and it works to pause the music too! I also think they are a really pretty color.",2023-08-16 14:51:45

6,B09LD1T57H,1,Negative,"Not sure how this thing has so many high star reviews. They are always falling out of my ear and the annoying part is that they are weirdly sensitive to touch. If a song is playing and they fall out no matter where you touch the headphones the music stops. Now I have have an issue where when wearing these the volume lowers by itself then all you hear in the headphones is ""volume minimized"". These headphones suck",2023-12-17 20:01:30

8,B0CHB9T8Q6,3,Neutral,"I only gave these a three star. But I got these so that I could listen to audiobooks on tape. For that I give them five stars. They were great but if someone phones me and wants to talk to me with my earbuds in, they really can’t understand me that well. They said my voice is muffled. So most people I think would like to use them as regular earbuds for talking. That’s why I gave them three stars. They’re not that good for talking. But five stars for listening to an audiobook.",2023-10-10 21:30:07
9,B09ZYCFDBL,4,Positive,"Really like the fit BUT the only part that you can touch to adjust the fit is the front surface - therefore, each time you touch one, you are also turning both on and off. It's impossible to insert the second one without also turning off the first. Once both are fitted properly, they are very comfortable and the battery life is good.",2023-12-01 05:44:41

14,B07ZD86BX7,4,Positive,"UPDATED 1/10/23: these constantly turn on and then connect to my Bluetooth perfectly and I start listening to my music or watch a video and it disconnects and I have to then stop what I’m doing and reconnect it. It’s annoying. Another thing I absolutely hate is when I hold down my finger on them to turn the volume up it then continues to say maximum volume for a minute straight so I end up having to turn them off and restart the whole damn thing. Annoying as heck. However regardless of these issues.. I use them daily and absolutely love them anyways. So worth the money. Battery life is incredible . I use them for like 6 hours a day for work and with a full charge they last a whole week! It’s insane!

These were so worth the money. The sound quality is absolutely amazing for the price! Such good base and it really does cancel the noise around you. Super impressed. However they are quite big and stick out of your ear. That’s one thing that bothers me. It’s huge sticking out of my ear. Other than that such good quality highly recommended",2023-12-10 10:45:25
15,B0B3WT1VXS,2,Negative,"When they were brand new they were phenomenal! But after about 2 months of use it seems like one of the drivers in the right ear bud isn’t working. I would’ve liked to have gotten longer use out of them.

17,B088H7GMHZ,5,Positive,"Bought for my son to pair to his phone. He was slightly dubious about the brand, which he hadn’t heard of, but I showed him the reviews and when he tried them he agreed they were indeed really good. He says they fit fine and give good audio quality. Benefit of the price is that if they get lost or damaged it’s not as big a deal as more expensive ones. Very happy!",2023-12-17 20:22:30
18,B09HMCQF4S,3,Neutral,"These are much bigger than expected and they hurt my ears. I bought a pair for my husband as well. When I talk to him on the phone when he has them in, they pick up more of the background noise than his voice.",2024-05-17 13:39:47

33,B07RJ3M2CM,2,Negative,"I really wanted these to work. I first bought a Tozo T10 but they did not fit at all. I then discovered T6 which were supposed to fit small ears. Sadly, they do not even with the smallest ear tip on. They fall out ALL the time and when you put them back in it's very hard not to touch the stop button so the music stops playing. I finally gave up on them when one fell into the oven while I was cooking! I ordered a different brand that actually fits small ear canals.",2023-10-05 09:04:10
34,B07RGZ5NKS,5,Positive,"I have used these new ear pods for three days and find them to have high quality sound and bass. Although they do not have active noise cancellation, if you wear the appropriately sized silicone ear adapters which are included, with appropriate fit, almost all environmental noise is blocked out.

I have been able to get 6 hours usage before needing to replace them into the charging case. The case was able to recharge the pods in about an hour and I have been able to get three full charges from the case before I needed to recharge the case. You simply lie the charging case on a wireless charging plate (sold separately) or plug them in using the included charging cord. The case fully charges in about two hours and has four indicator lights showing the level of charge.

I tested the water resistance by running under the tap to rinse and I placed them in a small bowl of water for a brief time to simulate and accidental drop and immersion. I shook out any residual water and allowed them to air dry for 15 minutes and they worked perfectly.

My last pair of Tozo ear pods were the T-10. The case for these T-6 pods is much smaller and fits in a pocket very easily. One issue I did have compared to the T-10 ear pods is that the lid on the T-6 charging case only opens 90 degrees making it slightly difficult for people like me to remove them. The top of the T-10 case opens 180 degrees giving better access. One other important difference anyone upgrading from the T-10 model to this better set of ear pods is that the T-10 pods only fit one way in the case. The left pod only fits on the left and the right pod only fits on the left side of the charging case. These T-6 pods will fit on either side of the case making it slightly more difficult to determine which is the right pod and which is the left pod if you aren't careful when replacing them to charge. Each pod is marked with an ""R"" and an ""L"" but it is very small and hard to read so you have to make certain you keep track of Left and Right not just for proper fit but to make sure the touch controls work appropriately. Each pod has a separate touch function.

Another thing that I really enjoy about these T-6 ear pods is their touch function. Once you place the pods in your ear, you simply need to lightly touch them to activate sound volume, advancing or reversing through your play list, and answering phone calls. Unlike other ear pods, the touch required is so sensitive, there is very little risk of knocking them out of your ears and dropping them.

These ear pods come with their own internal microphone so once paired to your mobile device, you don't have to rely on the phone's microphone. The microphone in these T-6 ear pods is good quality and when I placed phone calls with them in place, I was heard and understood by the person on the other end with no problems.

These earpods turn on automatically when removed from the charging device and give you an audible indication that the power is on, which pod is activated, right and left, and then when they link to each other. I tested their Bluetooth connectivity with my iPhone, my HP Laptop, and all five of my Bluetooth capable smart TVs and the connections are fast with great range.

These are great ear pods for their price range and are really high quality.",2023-09-13 22:54:20
35,B09HMCQF4S,3,Neutral,"These are good as a cheap alternative, but I’d recommend the better versions for a little more money. The sound quality on these are on the high end of tone and the low end is lack luster. Keep volume low or the speakers are toast. I’m a person who constantly drops mine out in the fields. So for someone like me, they get the job done without having to stress losing an earbud.",2023-12-17 03:14:15
36,B07ZD86BX7,2,Negative,"After reading so many great reviews, I didn't hesitate to buy these ear buds but I wish I hadn't. The battery life is seriously terrible, dying at about 2 hours on a single charge. Also when it reaches 20% battery life, it shuts itself off. The headphones are also a poor fit and fall out of my ears constantly. And waterproof?? What a joke. A little sweat touches them and makes the volume go down. Simply awful. I can only think all the other reviews are lies or bought because we can't have purchased the same thing.",2024-02-19 17:04:06

39,B08F263NLG,2,Negative,"I purchased these earbuds as a gift for my partner. I was looking for an affordable alternative to Apple earbuds and thought I had found it when I read the reviews. In fact I was so excited I bought two, one for my partner and one for her daughter, plus all the accompanying accessories for each. The sound quality is great but no matter how hard she tried she could not get them to stay put in her ear. She never worked out with them or even went on a walk for fear they would again fall out and she we loose or damage them. Sadly I returned them today with all the accessories I purchased as well. Looks like I will be paying the pretty penny after all.",2023-12-16 23:50:16

Received today needed to download the JBL Equalizer app that they promote. It was helpful & very much needed. Even with the app it doesn’t have as much Bass (if not any) from what it advertised & I’ve had the Beats earphones as well AirPods Pro’s.

46,B0BQPNMXQV,5,Positive,"When you see JBL on an audio product, you expect great quality at a reasonable price. And JBL did not disappoint with these wireless ear buds. I've had them about a month now, and I absolutely love them! Without a doubt, there are more on the market with a higher price point. But honestly, for the price, these just can't be beat. I can literally hear instrumental parts in my favorite songs that I've never heard before..... Keep up the good work JBL.",2023-08-17 19:45:30

48,B0BCKHQGJN,2,Negative,"The sound quality is good and the touch controls on the earbuds are alright. The battery life is great. These are what make it two star instead of one.

They don't work. I'll connect them to Bluetooth and only one will connect, so I have to put them back in the case to reset them then try again. Then the signal will intermittently cut out, so I have to put them back in the case to reset them. They're also really uncomfortable in the ear.

Not recommended.",2023-07-29 14:42:22

55,B08F1SX35C,4,Positive,"These are great for what they are. They are basic Bluetooth ear buds, nothing special. The sound isn't bad at all. I used them for a just shy of a year. This month they started making a horrible and loud digitized sound in the middle of listening to a song. It completely stopped the music and was just a loud, awful noise. But, it did work well for the year that it did work, and for the price I can't complain.
I have finally broken down and invested in the newest Airpods (Apple Airpod Pro Gen 2) SO, we'll see how well those hold up. Hopefully for a few years bc the price is currently $234.",2024-06-11 14:48:02
56,B09HN4DHFL,4,Positive,"They are good, sound and quality wise. However, I don't like how it suctions into my ear and it feels like when ur ear is blocked with water.

57,B09JC3S2PN,3,Neutral,I got these because i was tired of ear buds falling out. I thought these would grip back of ears better but there is space between ear and loop. Color is also more of a dusty rose then the shiny pink it shows.,2023-07-20 07:23:42

60,B09FLNSYDZ,3,Neutral,"The good - they work. They actually don't block out noise much at all (not like my previous earbuds) which I actually appreciate so I can still hear what's going on around me or if someone is trying to get my attention.

Sound quality - fair- I heard a very faint hiss/pop from the left ear one when I first used them as though there was some sort of electrical issue, but it went away after using & charging. Overall I don't think these block outside noise enough for the sound quality to be noticeable in most outdoor or active places.

The minor annoyance - if they are charging in the case and the case is bumped, they can disconnect from charging and briefly turn on and link to your phone before again turning off and resuming charging. If you were trying to answer a call or play a video on your phone when this happens it can be mildly disruptive to have it switch to bluetooth and then turn off/pause.

They don't fall off, but they don't necessarily stay all the way in your ear. You can press them in, but in my experience they work themselves back out a bit and overall they really don't work well for noisy environments. Perfectly fine for moderate or quiet places though.

Never ran the battery below 80% on the buds themselves... so I can't say for sure how long the battery lasts, but for using a few hours a day, I only needed to charge the case maybe every other week to keep it above 75%

The price was unbeatable. Very happy with the overall value.",2023-12-16 06:59:05

65,B09HMCQF4S,5,Positive,"I recently had the opportunity to try out the JLAB Go earphones, and I must say, they've left a lasting impression on me. Right out of the box, the sleek design and compact form factor of these earphones caught my eye. But it's not just their appearance that stands out - these earphones deliver on all fronts.

Firstly, the sound quality is exceptional. Whether I was listening to my favorite tracks or catching up on podcasts, the audio was crisp, clear, and balanced. The bass is punchy without being overpowering, and the highs are sharp without any hint of distortion. It's a listening experience that rivals earphones at a much higher price point.

Comfort is another area where the JLAB Go earphones shine. They come with a variety of ear tips to ensure a snug fit, and once they're in, they stay put. This is great for someone like me who's always on the move. Whether I'm running, commuting, or just doing chores around the house, these earphones fit so well that I almost forget I'm wearing them. No more constantly readjusting or dealing with ear fatigue after an hour of use.

Functionality is a breeze with the JLAB Go. Pairing them with my device was straightforward and only took a few seconds. The controls are intuitive, allowing me to manage my music and calls without having to take out my phone. This convenience factor is a big plus for me, as it allows for a more seamless and hands-free experience.

Lastly, the value of the JLAB Go earphones cannot be overstated. It's not often that you find a product that exceeds expectations without breaking the bank. They've managed to pack high-quality audio, comfort, and user-friendly features into an affordable package, which is something that deserves applause.

In conclusion, the JLAB Go earphones are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for high-quality, comfortable, and functional earphones without spending a fortune. Whether you're an audiophile on a budget or just someone who appreciates great sound and convenience, these earphones are sure to please. I highly recommend giving them a try – they might just become your go-to for daily listening.",2024-01-08 06:16:08

71,B09HMCQF4S,4,Positive,"These are excellent ear buds for the price. In general, I am very impressed.

There are no advanced whistles and bells such as ANC, but this is more than made up for with the excellent sound quality - amazing given the very reasonable £25 price.

Pairing is easy (I have connected them to my Lenovo tablet and our Hisense TV). Battery life is good at about 8 hours on a full charge.

Charging is via the carry case which also has a battery - very useful while out and about. The USB charging cable is neatly built into the carry case so it's all self contained - there's no loose cable to lose! I also like the rather unusual ""slate"" colour.

The buds come with 2 further sets of silicon ear tips (large and small), though I have found the factory fitted ones (medium) to be comfortable and secure. Each bud has an inbuilt microphone and each can be used separately. As such, they can be used for hands-free mobile calls in the car. That's not something I have tried as my mobile pairs to my car anyway.....

There are a few annoying points:
- The charging cable is annoyingly short.
- The changing connector is USB A rather than the more modern type C.
- The recommended Jlab App in the instructions doesn't support these ear buds yet!

Other than that, I am rather chuffed 😀 😊

UPDATE - Indeed, my wife was also impressed and has purchased a black pair (to avoid confusion) - see photo - she is also very happy.",2023-10-25 05:38:41

I often have people tell me they can't hear me well and I sometime struggle to hear them. I'm comparing this to my last set which were similar. Battery life is just OK but for the price they aren't bad. I won't repurchase these.,2023-09-26 19:49:28
74,B09HN4DHFL,3,Neutral,I really liked these but a year after using the right earbud no longer charges.,2024-01-19 14:29:52
75,B0C77RCN4X,5,Positive,I love how comfy they fit in my ear & the sound is great!,2024-03-06 01:45:58
76,B09HN4DHFL,5,Positive,Not premium but surprisingly good sound quality for not a lot of money.,2024-03-24 06:26:11
77,B088H7GMHZ,3,Neutral,Pretty good but the weird issue with one side disconnecting momentarily and increasingly dropping out altogether is slightly alarming. Is this common to all sets or just some? Not sure whether to live with it or inquire about recall?,2023-10-12 20:26:09
78,B0BQPNMXQV,2,Negative,"They’re are loosing fit in the ear, they fall out when you are eating.",2023-12-01 13:05:15
79,B0C5351V75,5,Positive,Expectations were exceeded when receiving these earphones. I have airpods but needed some that stay in much better for running which these do and the sound quality is very good,2023-12-06 00:24:55
80,B08F263NLG,2,Negative,won't stay in ears,2024-06-20 08:54:04
81,B081JNSRGZ,5,Positive,Bought 4 years ago and still work great,2024-03-27 07:17:49
82,B0CRH2SCCQ,4,Positive,"The quality of the sound is nice, I’m just really having trouble with the controls (like playing the previous or the next song). The sensor is working and all, but I can’t seem to use it with ease, especially when it’s in my ears…",2024-03-24 21:31:38
83,B0BYD11TJ2,4,Positive,Great they do the job whilst I'm walking but a bit difficult to go on to the next track without manually having to click on my screen,2023-09-06 17:06:50
84,B09ZYCFDBL,3,Neutral,Cute. They work... but the sound quality is no go. Treble is too high and hardly feel the bass. It'll be noticeable to any one who loves the bass . Otherwise they work.,2024-01-07 04:16:20
85,B0CHYBZ8L8,2,Negative,You get what you pay for. The sound keeps cutting out all the time. Worked great for a few weeks now they are crackly and sound cuts out.  Too late to send back now. Don't waste your money,2024-04-15 09:07:40
86,B0CHP177FN,5,Positive,"Seem to work fantastically and very clear
Fits well",2023-12-17 02:44:32
87,B09HMCQF4S,5,Positive,"The ear buds are really easy to use. The connection via bluetooth is easy to achieve. Haven't actually charged them since I bought them but haven't been using them regularly. The sound quality is really good and can be used when running. Had a few that kept falling out of my ear including the more expensive ones made for running, this one's stay in your ear without any issues.",2023-12-24 04:49:35
88,B09LD1T57H,5,Positive,Great ear buds. Good sound. Comfortable.,2023-09-25 07:01:10
89,B09JC3S2PN,2,Negative,They really not loud as I want them to be. I like their other ear buds way better. These hurt my ears even when I switched the bud out,2023-11-28 10:48:10
90,B09HN594TL,3,Neutral,"The headphones have been great until 3 months later. When I first stared using the headphones they were great. Now the sounds keeps weaving in and out like it’s disconnecting and coming back. Sometimes the sound goes off for about 5–10 seconds and then comes back on. The battery life is great, I don’t think its gone down to 50% ever and I use these at least 3-4 hours at a time",2023-08-16 20:22:51
91,B09LD44NW6,4,Positive,Buen desempeño y precio adecuado,2023-12-26 05:26:55
92,B0C5351V75,5,Positive,"A unique piece of equipment fits easily into the ears And continue to be secure, great sound battery seem to last a long time Before charging and would recommend this product good value for money",2023-12-24 21:19:24
93,B081JNSRGZ,5,Positive,I accidentally washed my partner's headphones and bought a new set for him before even bothering to see if they were ruined. He tried his old ones and they work perfectly fine after being submerged in water.,2023-10-28 04:21:16
94,B07VWT4XJG,3,Neutral,"Sound quality is okay, but the shape isn’t. These earbuds are bulky and oddly shaped. They don’t fit the ear well at all.",2023-10-18 01:42:54
95,B09HN594TL,5,Positive,"Absolutely no frills with these. But they're excellent for a cheap, good pair for earbuds. Come with various sleeve sizes too.",2024-03-14 04:09:39
96,B09ZYCFDBL,4,Positive,These earbuds work great for the price. I watch movies & listen to music with them.,2024-07-26 03:17:30
97,B09ZKYF7TX,4,Positive,"The earbuds work great sand sound great for the price. The only thing is the difference in the colors, but that's it.",2024-03-22 09:29:06
98,B0BQPNMXQV,4,Positive,"They have a great battery. I often am assigned positions at work where I could wear one headphone and listen to a book, while working. For that, it rescues my sanity from boredom and I am grateful. I enjoy the ease to be able to tap to pause, should somethingarise that requires full and immediate attention. However, if I try to do this on say a meal break, I find that the act of chewing seems to dislodge the headphones from my ear affecting the overall fit. There are other times I find this to be a possibility. Say while running or bending. It's rather annoying and I'd recommend a different set of headphones that don't require much discretion and cardio or bending. For a bus commute or stationary desk position, I think they work great. The price isn't bad either. They work fine for phone calls. This is my second set of these after losing my original pair. I'd probably buy them again if I lose these again. They are discreet enough in appearance that I often get away with them at work. I know I'm not the only one who does this either.",2023-08-28 21:22:29
99,B0C1BTXM9W,2,Negative,"For the price these are amazing! The pink color is more of a light salmon pink. I like them a lot. The only thing that I could say needs improvement is the connectivity. I will be out walking and they will disconnect. It doesn’t happen every time so I can’t say I’m mad, I just reconnect them and keep going. The sound quality to me is very good.",2024-03-01 23:01:32
100,B0B11L781C,3,Neutral,I had to send these back one was not working and they hurt my ear,2023-07-13 03:58:10
